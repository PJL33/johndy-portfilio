From Haiti, I'm an <strong class="text-danger">enthusiastic aspiring computer scientist</strong> with a creative twist. Through countless lines of code, I've discovered my passion for crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. My journey began with a fascination for <strong class="text-danger">algorithms</strong> and evolved into an obsession with <strong class="text-danger">web developpement and data science.</strong> With a fervor for innovation and a toolbox brimming with languages like <strong class="text-danger">HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python, PHP, and SQL,</strong> I thrive on transforming imaginative concepts into functional reality. However, my skills go beyond coding; I've also honed my <strong class="text-danger">leadership skills</strong> through <strong class="text-danger">entrepreneurship and in project management.</strong> This portfolio is a testament to my commitment to innovation through code and effective leadership.<br>

Although I enjoy learning new things, I am also enthusiastic about teaching them. As I used to say, knowledge is useless unless it is shared. This is why I teach some of my knowledge in computer science and entrepreneurship to younger people or fellows. As evidence, I'd like to share some of my favorite certificates with you.

            <h2><span class="bg-danger text-light">Standpoint and Experience</span></h2>
            <p class="text-light">I was an entirely introvert at school. I was the one whose name was more well-known than the person. I've been to several gatherings where my Standpoint may have been useful, but because I seldom spoke, I kept them all for myself. However, I recognized that my A+ or 9/10 will not provide me with a promising career. It became evident after my rejection from a UWC scholarship application.<br>  I was very sure of myself. I assumed that my A+ would secure me the scholarship, but I quickly understood that strong grades are necessary but insufficient. My first rejection was devastating. Following this failure, I resolved to pursue myself above and beyond my academics. My primary goal used to be to get high marks. Now I discover that I am much more than just a A+.<br>Since the end of my tenth grade, I've been voicing my opinions, giving advice, taking on leadership roles, competing, and so on. I realized how much value I could bring to my community. This is why I pledge I will no longer keep my opinions and recommendations to myself. In the <a>stanpoint section</a>, I discuss how I view depression, loneliness, and son and also how to overcome them now that I've experienced them. As an introvert, my voice will finally be heard, and I hope that my points of view on some important subject will be helpful to numerous individuals.</p>
            <p class="text-light">Next, I've seen many kids struggle with finding extracurricular activities during their senior year. As a result, I advise you young scholars to begin early in order to avoid going insane in your last year. My purpose is not to teach you about extracurricular activities you can participate in; rather, <a>I will highlight some of the things I participated in from high school through my gap year</a>. Perhaps you will find yourself in some of them. As you can see, I didn't discuss broad truths here; I discussed my point of view, and I am confident that you will find it as interesting as people in my community who I've influenced.</p>
            <p class="text-light">Finally, in the future, I intend to offer other intelligent introverts a chance to be heard. They will have their own area. If you're a brilliant introvert who wants to offer your thoughts on a certain topic, <a href="#contact-me">contact me.</a> Don't be frightened to show the world your brilliant mind. This is your chance; don't blow it.

            <p class="text-light">I'm still a work in progress. From my initial failure to now, I've grown and matured. Behind this progress, there are several persons that inspired me to improve myself. I wanted to introduce them to you all, and at the same time share what I've learned from them. Again, I am confident that some might help you. <a href="aspirers.html" class="text-danger">Meet my aspirants.</a></p>
            <p class="text-light">On the other side, everyone who knows me would tell you that I am a hard worker who is constantly motivated to achieve his objectives. However, most of the time, discipline rather than motivation keeps me going. <a>In the mantras area,</a> you'll discover several mantras that I constantly remind myself when I'm feeling down and need encouragement. Get inspired!

Recently, we collaborated during a Summer Leadership Program that my organization set up this summer, and Johndy was one of our team leaders. He conducted the students he was responsible of towards planning and presenting a social project in our ultimate Project Contest. I would say that on top of his academic aptitudes, Johndy exhibits many of those soft skills that are required for anyone’s success in this modern world.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2">JOHNDY was the president of my 12th grade class. This does not define that person, but I wanted to emphasize it, because you have to be able to convince a classroom and gain that confidence to be the president of a family. He is a hard worker, with big dreams and projects in his head. He is someone of great intelligence.<br> He is not someone who feels completely comfortable in public or in a group. Sometimes I feel like he goes to great lengths to hide his lack of comfort (very few people notice). He is, however, very sportive and an excellent learner. I say this not only because of his grades in high school, but especially because of his enthusiasm to learn and surpass himself.<br>He is a mature person, and I want to emphasize that his maturity comes from his experiences. At classical school, he demonstrated a capacity for reflection to which very few young people could devote the necessary time. His maturity allowed him to manage activities with attention to detail that others rarely paid. He is unusually frank, saying what he thinks, and he was often a source of good advice (Don't change this aspect of your personality).<br>It's no secret for those who have ever been around JOHNDY: he is extremely intelligent and mature. We have the impression that he feels alone, misunderstood. He works hard to achieve his dreams and projects to the point of forgetting to sleep. I have memories of JOHNDY exhausted, falling asleep in class with tired, red eyes.<br>A word of advice for you, JOHNDY: take the pressure off a little. I'm not telling you to forget your dreams or give up on them, but rather take care of yourself by getting more sleep to maintain your health and live a longer life, my friend. I believe in you, and I know that you have the potential to achieve all your dreams. Remember that rest and relaxation are equally important.</p>

He is a very innovative person, but there are also some people who doesn't like the way he is cold, you would say sometimes that he is not interest in people at all... I can say that ambition is never too much but he often lets his own get it in his head. He is also a person who is unpredictable, it is not a flaw nor a quality...

                    <p style="direction:ltr" class="mt-2">The quiestest person in the group. A friend you can count on. The boyfriend who doesn't know how to handle it.<br>
                      The originality that characterizes him makes him unique in his kind. With him, you never know what to expect. His creativity and intellectualism are his strengths. He always favors communication and is someone who is very frank.<br>
                      Johndy really wants to make his dream come true. He's so into what he does that he forgets to share a bit love with those who matter most to him. Sometimes, he seems detached and insensitive.<br>
                      Charm is not at all his strong point. His rebellious character, his sometimes very provocative behavior , destabilize more than one. One thing in certain , he is bossy and arrogant.<br>
                      Despite everything, from my experiences with him, i could notice that he is of an extraordinary specialty and does not know how to properly love others.<br>
                      He is unstable and tenacious. <br>
                      Johndy is a man of word who works hard to achieve his goals.<br>
                      I really believe  in him . He will be a legend one day.</p>

                      He is very observant, which makes him a man capable of conceiving a possible future situation. <br>
                      He is also very reserved, which sometimes decreases its social quality. However, he is for me my best male encounter since September 2022, someone on him everyone can count on thanks to his loyalty. He is a trustworthy friend.</p>

On this point, I want to tell you brother, that you'll find plenty of them, but you mustn't let them get to you, and you mustn't lose sight of your goals, because #YouGotAPlan.<br>Let me shout out loud that I've learned a lot from you, and I'm not the only one.</p>

He tends to persist even when they say no, He has an introverted side where sometimes He remains away from people. Moreover, He doesn't like to lose, sometimes it makes him behave mischievously. when he is angry he is categorical with his words. He has a keen sense of observation, and He is very attentive. He has a side of humor too, and He likes to admire beautiful girls. He is patient and a good counselor.</p>

Sometimes, he can be a bit strict when it comes to certain aspects, like expecting regular progress on a project, I became aware of this during my time on the team.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2">Johndy is a determined person, which is the greatest adjective I can find to describe his personality. When he finds an opportunity to help people, you have to admire his enthusiasm. The best time I've had the chance to observe his ego level is when he fails a competition, which proves to me that he can't stand failure. Johndy likes to succeed in the shadows; in my opinion, he prefers to work in silence and let success make the noise. <br>

                      However, Johndy is not an angel, my problem is that it's hard for me to find his faults because in one of them you can find many qualities, for example his curiosity, in certain situations he's short-tempered, the most important thing is that he finds a way to control himself. <br>
                      
                      Talking about Johndy can take a long time, so I've chosen these few words to say what I think of the man.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2">When you get on with someone by spending time together, it's easy to appear subjective when trying to devote a few words to them. One of those people whose thoughts are ahead of their environment, Johndy PHILISTIN is first and foremost a person with an extraordinary sense of observation, always seeking to propose solutions to the problems of those around him. Indeed, all Johndy's ideas are the result of observation, which is why they always seem important. He's also someone who prioritizes communication and order. Being both ambitious and stubborn, he does everything in his power to climb the ladder. So he doesn't let his weaknesses get in the way of his relationships with others, learning to take a step back. However, Johndy is far from being an impeccable person, and there can be ups and downs when this is part of your daily life, but his self-control prevents me from saying a few words about it.<br> I am therefore convinced that the path followed by Johndy PHILISTIN will enable him to achieve his objectives, one of which is to improve the way of life around him.</p>

                    <p style="direction:ltr">I was in the same school as Johndy, but we managed to get to know each other thanks to my sister because she was her friend. Without that, I could have spent all my time at school without ever recognizing him because he was a bit withdrawn. And I think that's how we became friends. He needed people to support him and help him believe in his skills and I was always available to help and be there for those who needed support. Despite everything, he knew how to shine thanks to his intelligence. He was the smartest in his class according to some, including me, and we could clearly name him among the smartest in the college !<br>
                      It wasn't until his senior year in college that Johndy truly showed the potential that existed within him. He didn't stop working hard throughout the year. He was first chosen as the president of the college and later participated in numerous competitions, including the Diamond Challenge. And currently he has an ongoing project <strong>Smartworker Corporation</strong>, an organization of which he is co-chair. I am sure that despite the situation in the country, he will succeed in his life because he works hard to get there and he deserves it.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2">"Determination, discipline, courage" : these three words to describe Johndy Philistin. He embodies these qualities in an exceptional way, which makes him truly unique. Johndy is always ready to take on the challenges that come his way.<br>
                      What impresses me the most about him is his unparalleled leadership and ability to inspire others, even in the smallest details. Having Johnny around is a constant source of motivation. His dedication to work is remarkable, and he knows how to generate enthusiasm in those around him to achieve common goals.</p>
