                  <p class="text-light"> <img src="img/aspirers/kichemy.png" alt="dorcena kichemy" width="30%" class="aspirer-img">Kichemy and I both attended the same primary and secondary school (College Dominique Savio - CODOSA). He is presently attending Berea College, where he is pursuing a dual-degree program. Every student will agree that he has an out-of-this-world entrepreneurial mindset. If there is a need, Kichemy sells it the next day. He even fabricated the necessities at times. His abilities expanded to the point that he won various entrepreneurial competitions, including <strong class="text-danger">ATHENA (2nd), DIAMOND CHALLENGE, and EMO-HAITI (in which I was his teammate).</strong></p>
                  <p class="text-light">Previously, I had little interest in this form of competition. However, he exposed me to this world, and I am now prepared to compete in any Entrepreneurial competition. I began with a <strong class="text-danger">Exposcience (finalist)</strong> and my most recent one is a <strong class="text-danger">Hultprize (4th)</strong>. I am grateful to him for introducing me to this world. <a class="text-danger">Click here</a> if want to get more knowledge about my last competition experiences.
                  </p>
                  <p class="text-light">Furthermore, being an introvert, I had never consented to the concept of publicizing my accomplishments. Because I don't want to brag, the less attention I had on myself, the better I felt. However, Kichemy made me realize that publicizing your accomplishments isn't the same as bragging. Instead, you encourage others to do the same and draw influential individuals to you. He was accurate. Since I began sharing my accomplishments, I've had multiple messages from individuals expressing their appreciation for what I'm doing, encouraging me to keep going, and inviting me to join them in a project they're working on.<br> I will not say that I always feel comfortable sharing my achievements but at least I know what I will gain  from it : <strong class="text-danger">Networking.</strong></p>
                  <p class="text-light">Thus, if you want to grow your network, you are now aware of what to do. If you have no achievement, go participating in competitions (not necessary entrepreneurial, it can be debate, robotic or any subject you are very fond of) or build your own project. GET OUT OF YOUR BUBBLE.</p>
