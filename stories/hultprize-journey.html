                <p>It all began with a dream—a vision to create personalized clothing with unique designs. The opportunity to bring this dream to life emerged when I was selected to participate in the on-campus Hultprize competition. It was more than a competition; it was a chance to turn my idea into reality.</p>

                <p>Before the competition, I was thrilled to be given the opportunity to present my innovative idea. The excitement of sharing my vision with others was immeasurable. The stage was set, and I was ready to share my idea that consists of creating clothes that allowed people to express their individuality.</p>

                <p>The journey was exhilarating, but it had its share of twists and turns. Despite my unwavering dedication, I didn't secure the top spot. Instead, I found myself in 4th place, just outside the automatic qualification for the next phase—the summits. It was a moment of disappointment and self-doubt.</p>

                <p>I didn't let that setback deter me. Desperation crept in, but in the face of adversity, the campus director became my guiding light. They advised me not to give up and encouraged me to apply for the summit independently. It was a decision that would change the course of my journey.</p>

                <p>With newfound determination, I followed the campus director's advice and submitted my project globally. The wait was nerve-wracking, but the moment that changed everything came when I received the news that my project had been chosen among the top 800 projects worldwide to attend the summit. It was a dream coming to life—a testament to the power of perseverance.</p>

                <p>The Milan summit, held online, was a transformative experience. It broadened my horizons, deepened my commitment to my idea, and brought me face-to-face with inspiring innovators from across the globe. It was there that I realized the true value of resilience and the significance of pursuing one's dreams.</p>

                <p>So, my message to everyone who has faced setbacks or doubts is simple: dreams are worth pursuing, even in the face of adversity. Follow your passion, believe in your potential, and don't hesitate to seek guidance when needed. It was just a competition, but it became a journey that taught me never to underestimate my own capabilities.</p>

                <p>My Hultprize journey may have had its share of ups and downs, but it's proof that with determination and the willingness to persevere, you can turn your dreams into reality.</p>
